I am Cooper Iacobelli. I have the following qualities:

- I enjoy working on detail sensitive projects

I didn't until I saw the CSCI 103 course description, and now I can't wait to explore all the exciting solutions I can create for my everyday life. I will learn all of the ways I can combine these two fun subject fields and enhance the world around me!
