I am Cooper Iacobelli and I am a 2026 Political Science Major! I have a very small amount of sewing expirience but can get by.

My programming expirience is about zero, although I have spent some time labeling data for machine learning software.

Even learning to make this website is a great start, I am excited to learn the basics.

I was born in 2001, yes boring.
