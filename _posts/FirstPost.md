My Name is Cooper Iacobelli and I am a Class of 2026 Political Science Major!
I have a very small amount of sewing expirience but can get by.
My programming expirience is about zero, although I have spent some time labeling data for machine learning software.
Even learning to make this website is a great start, I am excited to learn the basics.
I was born in 2001, yes boring.
